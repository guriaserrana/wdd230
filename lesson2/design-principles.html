            <p>When designers move elements closer together or farther apart, they are employing the principle of proximity. 
            There are two major reasons why a designer would employ proximity: 
            to create connections or deploy them.<br>
            This site is an example of proximity. The more we scroll through the screen, the more topics appear,
            giving an impression of being closer and closer to our vision.</p>

        <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
        <h3>Up Nature</h3>

            <p>Repetition is achieved by repeating an element more than once throughout a design. 
            While this may seem simple, designers depend on the principle of repetition to create a feeling 
            of organized movement and consistency within a composition. In any design, you'll find yourself having to repeat elements, 
            but by doing so, you'll be able to strengthen and unify the visual appeal of a design.</p>

        <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
        <h3>The Marginalian</h3>
        <picture>

        <p>People say that opposites attract and this can be true for elements of design as well. Imagine a composition without 
        contrast –every color, font, shape, etc. would be the same size, and that design would be rather dull. 
        Contrast is the tool that makes a design “pop,” making it memorable for viewers.
        Contrast also aids in the usability of a composition. A design's organization is 
        dependent upon how contrast is used to lead a viewer's eye towards what is most important.</p>
