        <p class="text">In the beginning of the 17th century, the arrival of the first Europeans established the town. 
            The growing of the Campos de Lajens was due to the opening of roads to reach the fields of the 
            state Rio Grande do Sul. The people of São Paulo and Minas Gerais were attracted to this region 
            due to the cattle-breeding business with the gauchos.
            Very primitive documents mention Lajens as a stop for horse riders that were traveling from Sorocaba 
            or São Paulo, transporting mules, horses and cattle. Correia Pinto, the founder, was a horse rider, 
            and ran cattle groups from Lajens to São Paulo.        
            On November 22, 1766, Lajens was promoted to state from village. In 1820 it detached itself from São Paulo 
            to be part of the state of Santa Catarina. On May 25, 1860, it was elevated to city status. 
            In 1960 the city's name was changed to Lages with a "g" wrongly inserted.        
            During the Revolução Farroupilha, Lages belonged to the state of Rio Grande do Sul.        
            Lages is served by Antônio Correia Pinto de Macedo Airport and Planalto Serrano Regional Airport 
            located in the adjoining municipality of Correia Pinto.</p>

        <p class="text">Lages has a subtropical highland climate (Koppen: Cfb), with an annual mean temperature of 16 °C (61 °F). 
            Winter temperatures can stay below freezing, with occurrence of frost and snow. During the summer, 
            temperatures may reach 30 °C (86 °F) and droughts may occur.</p>

        <p class="text">The industrial park of Lages consists, to a large extent, of enterprises linked to the wood production chain, 
            such as lumber mills, staple factories, door factories, thresholds, jambs and the like. However, 
            companies linked to the metal-mechanic sector play an important role in generating employment and income 
            in the municipality, specifically in the field of tractor parts and other land vehicles. Furthermore, 
            some large industries have branches in the municipality, such as AmBev, Vossko and Klabin. Textile companies 
            (various branches such as curtains, uniforms and underwear) have recently started to settle in the city, 
            due to lack of manpower on the coast and in Vale do Itajaí.</p>

        <p class="text">It is known as the "National Capital of Rural Tourism". Rural tourism in Lages started in 1984, at Fazenda Pedras Brancas, 
            pioneer of the modality in Brazil. Centennial farms in the region began to adapt to receive visitors and tourists 
            who wanted to know the peasant lifestyle, with milking, plantations, "mountain" cuisine, etc.
            Similar to the contact with nature, the "Municipal Ecological Park" is also visited (with 2.3 million square meters, 
            established in 1997 in the urban perimeter, where you can find endangered species such as the blue jay, in addition 
            to 14 migratory species) and the "Salto do Rio Caveiras"</p><br>
